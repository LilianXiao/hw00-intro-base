## Notes
**Cube class:**
I listed the normals and positions manually (24 normals specifically), then constructed a loop to calculate the indices (counterclockwise 0, 1, 2, 0, 2, 3 format).  I then created an instance of it in main and rendered it using Lambert.

**Color controls:**
I added 'color' to controls, then created a helper function that converts hex into vec4, since dat.GUI outputs color as a string (within, I did some regex and parsing to clean and convert the string).  I then added the color picker in main function, and ensured the color would update by doing lambert.setGeometryColor(hexToVec(controls.color)) in the tick function.  This initially did not result in the color picker transferring to the object, since color was being hardcoded to red in OpenGLRenderer.  To get around this, I created a new color parameter in the render function and used setGeometryColor(color) there, which fixed the problem.

**Custom fragment shader:**
I had the idea of using Perlin to create a shifting rainbow color across the object.  To do this, I first created a noise helper function that behaves like a hash (the output vec3 will be used in randomizing the gradients).  My 3D perlin function creates randomized gradients using the noise func for each 8 cells and calculates each surflet.  I then used a smooth fade function in 3-step interpolation to output the final float.  To further improve my choice of noise, I also created a small fbm function that will overlay multiple perlins using set amplitude and frequency, then summing the altered perlins in a for loop.  I then made a simple "rainbow" function that uses cos to output my desired rainbow gradient coloration.  Using u_Time as an input creates the ultimate color scrolling effect.

**Custom vertex shader:**
I wanted to make some sin-based vertex deformation that can be altered by frequency, so I created phase and displace floats that depend on frequency, speed, and amplitude parameters.  I then deformed the vertices by displacing object position along the y-axis.  To make the object rotate, I created a simple rotation matrix and then rotated the position over time about the x-axis.  When rendering an icosahedron, the sin-based deformation is a lot more visible than with the cube or square, which do not have subdivisions.

*During the process I created multiple new uniforms, which I have set up in ShaderProgram.  This covers amplitude, frequency, and speed that I used in my vertex shader, as well as noise scale, strength, and speed that I used in my frag shader.  Importantly, I had to create a time uniform as well as some noise and time setting functions; in main I kept track of seconds elapsed since starting time, which I then used to set time for my custom shader.

*I implemented the gui color control after I did the shaders, so it temporarily broke my custom shader (the object rendered completely white).  The solution was to just set geometry color with the control color like I had to do with lambert.  The color picker input isn't very useful with the custom shader regardless due to the color shifting.


## Objective
- Check that the tools and build configuration we will be using for the class works.
- Start learning Typescript and WebGL2
- Practice implementing noise

## Forking the Code
Rather than cloning the homework repository, please __fork__ the code into your own repository using the `Fork` button in the upper-right hand corner of the Github UI. This will enable you to have your own personal repository copy of the code, and let you make a live demo (described later in this document).

## Running the Code

1. [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Node.js is a JavaScript runtime. It basically allows you to run JavaScript when not in a browser. For our purposes, this is not necessary. The important part is that with it comes `npm`, the Node Package Manager. This allows us to easily declare and install external dependencies such as [dat.GUI](https://workshop.chromeexperiments.com/examples/gui/#1--Basic-Usage), and [glMatrix](http://glmatrix.net/).

2. Using a command terminal, run `npm install` in the root directory of your project. This will download all of those dependencies.

3. Do either of the following (but we highly recommend the first one for reasons we will explain later).

    a. Run `npm start` and then go to `localhost:5660` in your web browser

    b. Run `npm run build` and then go open `dist/index.html` in your web browser

## Module Bundling
One of the most important dependencies of our projects is [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/). Webpack is a module bundler which allows us to write code in separate files and use `import`s and `export`s to load classes and functions for other files. It also allows us to preprocess code before compiling to a single file. We will be using [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/home.html) for this course which is Javascript augmented with type annotations. Webpack will convert Typescript files to Javascript files on compilation and in doing so will also check for proper type-safety and usage. Read more about Javascript modules in the resources section below.

## Developing Your Code
All of the JavaScript code is living inside the `src` directory. The main file that gets executed when you load the page as you may have guessed is `main.ts`. Here, you can make any changes you want, import functions from other files, etc. The reason that we highly suggest you build your project with `npm start` is that doing so will start a process that watches for any changes you make to your code. If it detects anything, it'll automagically rebuild your project and then refresh your browser window for you. Wow. That's cool. If you do it the other way, you'll need to run `npm build` and then refresh your page every time you want to test something.

We would suggest editing your project with Visual Studio Code https://code.visualstudio.com/. Microsoft develops it and Microsoft also develops Typescript so all of the features work nicely together. Sublime Text and installing the Typescript plugins should probably work as well.

## Assignment Details
1. Take some time to go through the existing codebase so you can get an understanding of syntax and how the code is architected. Much of the code is designed to mirror the class structures used in CIS 460's OpenGL assignments, so it should hopefully be somewhat familiar.
2. Take a look at the resources linked in the section below. Definitely read about Javascript modules and Typescript. The other links provide documentation for classes used in the code.
3. Add a `Cube` class that inherits from `Drawable` and at the very least implement a constructor and its `create` function. Then, add a `Cube` instance to the scene to be rendered.
4. Read the documentation for dat.GUI below. Update the existing GUI in `main.ts` with a parameter to alter the color passed to `u_Color` in the Lambert shader.
5. Write a custom fragment shader that implements FBM, Worley Noise, or Perlin Noise based on 3D inputs (as opposed to the 2D inputs in the slides). This noise must be used to modify your fragment color. If your custom shader is particularly interesting, you'll earn some bonus points.
6. Write a custom vertex shader that uses a trigonometric function (e.g. `sin`, `tan`) to non-uniformly modify your cube's vertex positions over time. This will necessitate instantiating an incrementing variable in your Typescript code that you pass to your shader every tick. Refer to the base code's methods of passing variables to shaders if you are unsure how to do so.
7. Feel free to update any of the files when writing your code. The implementation of the `OpenGLRenderer` is currently very simple.

## Making a Live Demo
When you push changes to the `master` branch of your repository on Github, a Github workflow will run automatically which builds your code and pushes the build to a new branch `gh-pages`. The configuration file which handles this is located at `.github/workflows/build-and-deploy.yml`. If you want to modify this, you can read more about workflows [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions).

Once your built code is pushed to `gh-pages`, Github can automatically publish a live site. Configure that by:

  1. Open the Settings tab of your repository in Github.

  2. Scroll down to the Pages tab of the Settings (in the table on the left) and choose which branch to make the source for the deployed project. This should be the `gh-pages` branch which is automatically created after the first successful build of the `master` branch.

  3. Done! Now, any new commits on the `master` branch will be built and pushed to `gh-pages`. The project should be visible at http://username.github.io/repo-name.
Â 

To check if everything is on the right track:

1. Make sure the `gh-pages` branch of your repo has a files called `index.html`, `bundle.js`, and `bundle.js.map`

2. In the settings tab of the repo, under Pages, make sure it says your site is published at some url.

## Submission
1. Create a pull request to this repository with your completed code.
2. Update README.md to contain a solid description of your project with a screenshot of some visuals, and a link to your live demo.
3. Submit the link to your pull request on Canvas, and add a comment to your submission with a hyperlink to your live demo.
4. Include a link to your live site.
